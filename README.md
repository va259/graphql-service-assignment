   and _VERIFY_TOKEN_URL_ (url for jwt verification in Users service)
3. You can install node modules by:
    ```bash
   # separately in each service folder
   npm i
   
   # separately for each service from the root directory
   npm run install:%serviceName%
   
   # for all services (install dependencies for root folder and it will install nested dependencies in postinstall script)
   npm i
   ```
4. To run services:
   ```bash
   # separately in each service folder
   npm run:start:dev

   # separately for each service from the root directory
   npm run run:%serviceName%

   # all services watch+debug
   npm run run:all:dev
   
   # all services watch
   npm run run:all
   
   # all services prod mode
   npm run run:all:prod
   ```

## Mongo

The application is using MongoDB as a database. Feel free to choose any solution for it, however it's highly recommended to use Docker and the official image for it.
